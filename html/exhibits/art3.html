<h2>What is Art?</h2>
<h3>What defines an image as art? Typically, paintings or other images deemed art are assumed to have been created to visually please or pique interest. There might also be a particular style or manner of work that is focused upon which ultimately births a product which could also be considered art even if the final creation were less of the focus of the creator than the efforts they put into the process. Something else that may be an implicit assumption for most people would be the intention of the final productâ€™s uniqueness. Can something be art if it is not unique?</h3>
<h2>Derivation of art</h2>
<h3>A related question would be what makes something unique. People often derive inspiration from others and other works. There are likely to be tiny variances even when someone attempts to copy or model heavily from sources of inspiration explicitly for practice, but what degree of difference is necessary between two things to make the newer product unique in its own right? An artist may have the intent to create something unique but fail to sufficiently highlight specific ideas or stylistic differences which they focused on to make a work like something else, but then only have others see it as a derivative of the inspiration without its own merit. How should a product be treated without direct human intent to maintain specific similarities or create key differences to another work, but the result is blatant similarity regardless?</h3> 
<h3>These considerations are important for art generated by Artificial Intelligence, especially if the AI is trained from existing art. Can extensively pulling from preexisting artworks truly make something unique, and is it ethically sound to do so? </h3>
