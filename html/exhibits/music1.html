<h2>What is music?</h2>
<h3>The website jukebox, shown here, allows users to create their own A.I. generated music. What defines something as its own unique piece of music? If nuance is ignored, a lot of music could be considered a compilation of sounds, pitches, durations, and sometimes vocal components relative to one another to result in a whole composition. Some music might be created with an explicit intent to be abstract, but do other compilations need to have their own purposes or intents as they are created to be considered music? Just as occurs with the creation of visual art, as artificial intelligence develops in sophistication, the consideration of conscious intent or a human element in art becomes more necessary to determine what holds merit and needs to be protected.</h3>
<h2>Music uniqueness</h2>
<h3>People are only able to distinguish a certain degree of rhythms, melodies, and harmonies if patterning is similar enough between two different works, and copyright issues begin to become important with music too much like its predecessors even if copying is not the intent of a human composer. When it comes to music-generating AI, pulling from existing published pieces of music brings up ethical concerns. What degree of similar content makes a piece of music derivative, and can AI music generators be made to avoid this issue? Additionally, is it an issue for AI music generators to attempt to create all the permutations of notes and rhythms that could be recognizable musical phrases while composers try to create unique music individually?</h3>
<h2>Human vs AI-generated music</h2>
<h3>The careers of music artists are also put into question through the publication of AI-generated pieces regardless of whether a fair definition would declare these pieces to be music in their own right. If listeners cannot always tell the difference between human-made music and AI-generated works, how can the livelihood of artists be protected with the competition of AI-generated works being churned out if the latter is given just as much flexibility or presented with the same amount of merit?</h3>
