<h1>The Fairness Of Art</h1>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<h3>This piece of artwork won first place in a digital arts competition at a Colorado State Fair. Common understandings of art and rules for competitions do not necessarily consider AI as a potential factor. Even if AI art does not explicitly violate rules, should it be held separate from human artwork? Additionally, this piece was not clearly recognized as the work of Artificial Intelligence. Should it be necessary to declare if a work is not entirely human-made? If a work can pass off as expected human artwork, does it even matter? The concerns ultimately boil down to whether there should be protections for visual art made by humans, especially if growing sophistication of AI art threatens these types of careers. </h3>
