<h2>The Good and Bad</h2>
<h3>What are Deepfakes? They are a realistic but fake representation of someone, especially of a famous person, to portray them performing actions or behaving in a certain way that would not necessarily occur in reality. A deepfake is defined by Merriam-Webster as “an image or recording that has been convincingly altered and manipulated to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something that was not actually done or said.” Specific examples of deepfakes like the one seen of ex-President Barack Obama highlight just how dangerous they can be. Deepfakes can be used to spread misinformation that could truly harm and affect the lives of others.</h3>
