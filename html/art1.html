<h2>Definition of Art</h2>
<h3>Merriam-Webster defines art as “the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the production of aesthetic objects” or “works so produced.”</h3>
<h2>Implications for AI</h2>
<h3>Regarding the creation of artistic images by Artificial Intelligence, this brings up several questions. Can AI be considered to utilize ‘skill,’ and does the skill of those who programmed the AI qualify? Furthermore, could AI ever be considered ‘conscious’ for the application of its abilities?</h3>
<h2>Ethical Concerns for Artists</h2>
<h3>From an ethical standpoint, this also concerns people who paint or create other visual art for a living. If AI were considered to fulfill this consciousness requirement, what preserves the merit of humans creating art more directly than the way AI creates it? Even if AI never fulfills this requirement of consciousness to create products officially defined as art, how can the art that people create continue to be valued and protected as AI becomes faster and more sophisticated in its creation of images meant to mimic and compete with it?</h3>
