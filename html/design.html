<h3>
The process of designing our app was made up of multiple stages. We went through several ideas before arriving on the museum design, which helps to bring a more engaging experience for users. We then spent plenty of time conceptualizing how we wanted users to interact with and move through the museum, eventually settling on a version of the current design. Our core vision was to create an app that gave the user control to go wherever they wanted, while still guiding them to learn and consider the complexities of AI and its relationship with copyright law and ethics.

<h3>
As we progressed in development the design shifted towards both UI design and the creation of art assets. We aimed to create a responsive but appealing UI with accessibility in mind. This included ensuring that the color palette was similar between screens and had high contrast in order to highlight important areas. We also wanted to keep the main text and images themselves relatively clutter free. One other element of the UI whch helped us to realize our vision of the app was allowing for the virtual paintings to be clickable themselves. This tends to be quite intuitive for users while remaining visually clutter-free.
