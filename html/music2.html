<h2>Definitions of Music</h2>
<h3>Melancholia by SKYGGE is an album that combines both traditional music creation designs and implements new ones by using fragments of music created by artificial intelligence in order to create new music. Merriam-Webster defines music as “vocal, instrumental, or mechanical sounds having rhythm, melody, or harmony” or “the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity.”</h3>
<h2>Is aesthetic or emotional appeal required?</h2>
<h3>Regarding the merit of AI-generated works as music, these definitions raise philosophical questions that affect what merit they hold in comparison to human-made compositions. Merriam-Webster in turn defines a melody as “a sweet or agreeable succession or arrangement of sounds,” or “a rhythmic succession of single tones organized as an aesthetic whole;” is it then possible for AI-generated works to be considered to have a melody if the AI does not have a sense of “sweetness,” “agreeability,” or “aesthetics?” A similar question also exists for rhythm and harmony whether they require some sort of emotional appeal or aesthetic sense within their creation to qualify as these components. If not, then AI could easily be considered to produce valid music according to the first definition. </h3>
<h2>Maintaining continuity </h2>
<h3>Along the lines of the second definition, can AI apply its behavior in a way that constitutes a “science” or an “art” in the first place? Furthermore, what gives a composition “unity” or “continuity?” Any completed work that could be considered music has “unity” in that it is a composed unit, and it has “continuity” so far as it continues from a start to a finish within that unit, but this classification is somewhat thin. “Unity” could imply an emotional “togetherness” of the different parts of a composition to leave specific emotion with the whole, but even with an understanding of how different emotions link to different types of music an AI would supposedly need to be somehow deliberate throughout to maintain an emotional state or journey, or risk breaking an aspect of the piece’s “continuity.” This would make it much more difficult for AI to generate a work definable as “music,” given the prerequisite of it having a comprehensive understanding of human emotion and its relation to the components of music.</h3>
