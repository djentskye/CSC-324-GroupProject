<h2>Is this new music?</h2>
<h3>A.I. music generation has evolved to the point where one can even create longer versions of songs made by other artists. In this specific example, the song “Never Going to Give You Up” by Rick Astley is lengthened and made through A.I. music generation using Jukebox. This raises many questions regarding the ethicality of such a procedure. Is this legal? Is this considered new and different music? A parody? These are questions one must answer in order to understand A.I. music’s place within music as a whole and as an art form.</h3>
